❗  ❗   ❗       
Please Read the original repository's README, as I haven't copy-pasted that text here. I have only extended and added some features.
This is primarily an update over the <a href="https://github.com/Florastamine/winauth">https://github.com/Florastamine/winauth</a> fork (at 2020-09-01).
I've added only several things:
- Search-box to quickly filter the desired sites from list
- Option to drag &drop QR-image onto the Add-Authenticator window.
- Option to auto-copy the one-time code if the searched result is single.
- Option to auto-close app  (to save an extra click) when you copy the code..
- Standalone .exe file is being produced by Costura.Fody.
- Fixed "Auto-Update" interval option being erased on next re-open.
