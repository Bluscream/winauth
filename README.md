❗   ❗   ❗     Please Read the <a href="https://github.com/winauth/winauth">original repository's README</a> to find out about WinAuth. Here we made a new fork (which includes <a href="https://github.com/Florastamine/winauth">Florastamine 2020-09-01</a> updates: removing support for NET 3.5, Yubikey and some obsolete things). We have added some nice features:

- Search-box to quickly filter the desired sites from list
- Option to drag &drop QR-image onto the Add-Authenticator window.
- Option to auto-copy the one-time code if the searched result is single.
- Option to auto-close app  (to save an extra click) when you copy the code..
- Standalone .exe file is being produced by Costura.Fody.
- Fixed "Auto-Update" interval option being erased on next re-open.
